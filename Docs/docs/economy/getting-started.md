# Getting Started With Tilia

<SellerNotification/>

Before you can use the Creator Economy, you need to request authorization from Tilia, VRChat's payment partner. Tilia ensures that you have a safe selling experience by verifying your identity, complying with local laws, and detecting fraud.

To get started, watch the video or read the steps below:

## Step 1 - Open Marketplace

Ensure that your personal information is correct! Otherwise, you may not be able to use the Creator Economy.

## Step 4 - Wait

Wait for your Tilia to accept your information. This usually takes around 5 business days, but may rarely take up to 30 calendar days.

If it takes Tilia longer to accept you than expected, please try the following these steps:

- Repeat [Step 2](#step-2---get-started) and click "Get Started with Tilia" again.
	- Tilia may have already accepted you. If that's the case, clicking "Get Started" may cause VRChat to check your acceptance and redirect you to the Storefront page.
- Check your inbox.
	- You may have already been accepted, or there may be an issue. Tilia may reach out to you via Email 
- If you continue experiencing technical problems, please contact Tilia or VRChat.

## Step 5 - Accepted

Once you've been accepted, the **Storefront** page will now show that you are **Authorized** to sell in VRChat! Any credits earned from now on will be eligible for [payout](/economy/payout).
