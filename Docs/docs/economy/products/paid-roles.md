Paid roles are the easiest way to monetize your VRChat Group. By creating and activating a paid role, users will be able to support you with VRChat Credits and become members of your Group. 

Paid roles are directly tied to your **Listings**. You can add [UdonProducts](/economy/products/udon) to a Listing and use UdonProducts in your world.
## Creating a paid role

1. Navigate to [vrchat.com/home](https://vrchat.com/home)
2. Go to your **Groups** tab in the left-hand sidebar.
3. After choosing a Group you own, go to **Settings** > **Roles**.
4. Choose **Create Paid Role**.
    1. Note: You will be prompted to agree to the Tilia Terms of Service before you can set up paid roles. [Read on setting up with Tilia here.](/economy/getting-started)
