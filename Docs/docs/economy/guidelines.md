# Content Guidelines

import SellerNotification from '/docs/economy/_sellers-notification.mdx';

<SellerNotification/>

Creators who sell content through VRChat's Creator Economy must adhere to the following rules and guidelines.

Please note that the Creator Economy is a growing and evolving system. These rules are subject to change as VRChat continues to explore new implementations and use cases. 

All Creator Economy content must follow the rules below.

## General
1. You must follow VRChat's [Terms of Service](https://hello.vrchat.com/legal).
	1. This includes the [Creator Economy Program Rules](https://hello.vrchat.com/legal/economy), [Community Guidelines](https://hello.vrchat.com/community-guidelines), and [Creator Guidelines](https://hello.vrchat.com/creator-guidelines).
	2. You may only sell content that you fully own or have the legal right to distribute, including any third-party elements. Ensure you have the necessary licenses or permissions. (See section 8.4 of VRChat's [Terms of Service](https://hello.vrchat.com/legal))
2. If your content is found to be in violation of VRChat's [Terms of Service](https://hello.vrchat.com/legal) or any of the Content Guidelines listed on this page, you must make reasonable efforts to address the violation within 10 days of being alerted via email of the issue.
	1. For example, if your avatar contains content activated by use of a toggle that is not permitted on the marketplace, you must make reasonable efforts to upload a new avatar build that removes this content within 10 days of being notified.
3. Clearly define what the user is purchasing.
	1. Listings, subscriptions, and products should have clear names and sufficiently detailed descriptions.
	2. Content should avoid engaging in [Dark Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_pattern) (or Deceptive Design Patterns) such as misdirection, bait-and-switching, and others.
	3. Content must avoid false advertising and not misrepresent the content or prices of listings and subscriptions. Names, tags, descriptions, acknowledgements, images, and previews used should not be misleading. Keep in mind that if your content looks very different in VRChat than in the images you've used to showcase it, buyers may be disappointed.
	4. Listings containing different types of products should make it clear where those products can be used. For example, if you are selling a bundle containing [avatar products](/economy/products/avatar) *and* [Udon products](/economy/products/udon), ensure the buyer understands that while they can use the avatars anywhere, the Udon Products can only be used in specific world(s).
	5. If your content's capabilities differ between platforms, you must disclose this to buyers. For example, if some features are PC-exclusive, explain it in the product description.
4. If feature parity exists, the Creator Economy should be used in addition to any off-platform monetization methods.
	1. For example, if perks or benefits for a VRChat world are sold through an off-platform subscription service, then those perks should also, when possible, be available for purchase in the Creator Economy.
	2. Don't price your external offering to drive VRChat users off-platform.
	3. If you cannot replicate the same external monetization offering inside VRChat (e.g. avatar source file downloads), these rules may not apply to you. Feel free to explore the Creator Economy's current offerings. If VRChat does not currently support your monetization method, try your best, and make a [feature request](https://feedback.vrchat.com/creator-economy).
5. Don't use VRChat's Creator Economy systems as a marketing tool for your external monetization offerings. For example:
	1. Don't prompt customers to refund their purchase and use a different payment method instead.
	2. Don’t use your listing description to advertise a cheaper price on other platforms.
	3. Don't encourage users to purchase your content on another platform so they can gain access to source files.
6. You cannot use VRChat Credits as a method of fundraising.
	1. Fundraiser payment methods must be hosted outside of the VRChat platform.
	2. It is allowed to ask for donations for external fundraisers that are not funded through the Creator Economy.
	3. You are permitted to ask for donations through your supporters, though donations towards fundraisers and charity organizations are often taxed differently between countries, and should be managed only with fiat currencies.
7. Costs should always be displayed in "VRChat Credits", the VRChat Credit icon<ThemedCreditIcon/>,
 or "\V".
	1. Many users are in different countries with different currencies. Use "VRChat Credits" to correctly convey the cost of your products to your buyers.

## Worlds
1. Worlds cannot promote lotteries, raffles, or other "games of chance" involving real currency.
	1. Any systems integrating with real-world currency in methods of gambling, casino-style events, or with real-world benefits are strictly forbidden.
2. You cannot give a user a strictly negative experience in your world without having made a purchase.
	1. For example, you may block access to paid content in your world, but you must clarify why they don't have access and/or allow them to buy access.
3. Your [instant](/economy/listings#instant) listings, [temporary](/economy/listings#temporary) listings, and [subscriptions](/economy/subscriptions) may not be priced higher than 10,000<ThemedCreditIcon/>.
## Avatars
1. Your avatar must be optimized and not cause significant performance issues in VRChat.
	1. Your avatar should have a performance rank of "Excellent," "Good," "Medium," or "Poor." 
	2. "Very Poor" avatars are only accepted on a case-by-case basis.
2. Your avatar must have a high degree of visual and technical fidelity.
	1. Avatars with cross-platform support are highly recommended. If your avatar is available on multiple platforms (e.g. PC, Android and/or iOS), its appearance should be similar on all platforms.
	2. If your avatar uses [expression menus](/avatars/expression-menu-and-controls/) or [components](/avatars/avatar-dynamics/), avoid technical issues or bugs.
3. In general, your avatar's updates should be limited to bug fixes, performance improvements, and new/improved features.
	1.  If you want to visibly and materially change a base avatar that has already been purchased, please contact us to discuss it. We may adjust this policy in the future.
4. Your avatar must not use colliders or [stations](/worlds/components/vrc_station/) to fly, teleport, or move quicker than other VRChat avatars.
	1. For example: You may use GoGo Loco, but not GoGo Flight.
5. Your avatar must not allow users to hide from other users by becoming invisible.
	1. For example: Do not make it impossible for other players to find your avatar in a hide-and-seek game.
6.  If your listing contains [avatar products](/economy/products/avatar), its price must be at least 1,200<ThemedCreditIcon/> per different avatar product in the listing, excluding variants of the same avatar. For example:
	1. If your listing contains two different avatars, it must cost at least 2,400<ThemedCreditIcon/> (1,200 <ThemedCreditIcon/> × 2).
	2. If your listing contains two variants of the same avatar, i.e. different colors or outfits, it must cost at least 1,200<ThemedCreditIcon/>.
	3. If your listing contains a single avatar, it must cost at least 1,200<ThemedCreditIcon/>.
7. Your avatar must follow the avatar content guidelines below.
	1. If your listing contains avatar products and Udon products, ensure that the Udon product is also consistent with the content guidelines below.

:::info

VRChat may reject some avatars despite fulfilling all the criteria above. VRChat currently only accepts a limited number of avatars. High-quality avatars are more likely to be accepted.
 
This restriction will become less strict in the future. Please visit our avatar seller Discord community for additional information.

### Avatar content guidelines

The guidelines below clarify what type of content is suitable for the avatar marketplace. These content guidelines apply to all configuration and viewing options for an avatar. Content that violates these guidelines in an alternate state or viewing mode (e.g. through a toggle, hidden in a texture, or otherwise "locked" to be inaccessible to the user) is not permitted.
 
#### Properties

1. Your avatar's name, description, tags, acknowledgements, images, and previews for marketplace avatars must adhere to VRChat's [public content guidelines](https://hello.vrchat.com/creator-guidelines) for avatars.  
2. English must be the primary language of all words or characters in your avatar's properties, textures, or expressions menus.  
    - You're permitted to add additional non-English translations (with English equivalents).  
    - For example: The text in your expressions menu must be in English, but you may use icons to provide a Japanese translation.
3. Your avatar's name must start with an alphanumerical character. For example:
	- ✅Alice - Astronaut
	- ✅8-Bit Bob!!!
	- ❌- Alice - Astronaut
	- ❌!!!8-Bit Bob!!!
#### Clothing & Appearance

Your avatar must have private areas appropriately covered or presented in a non-sexualized manner.

The marketplace allows creativity and stylization, but avatars should avoid conveying overt sexuality or nudity. For example, private areas with patterned textures may convey a sense of being covered, while flat shading resembling skin may imply nudity.
