<SellerNotification/>

Stores allow you to sell your [listings](../listings) and [subscriptions](../subscriptions) in VRChat. You can have multiple stores - one for each world and group.

You can arrange your listings from your stores' pages to control the order users see them in, ensuring your best listings get the attention they deserve.

You can manage your stores in the [Store Manager](https://vrchat.com/home/marketplace/storefront/stores) on VRChat's website.

## Types of stores

There are currently two different types of stores:

- Group stores allow you to sell [subscriptions](/economy/subscriptions).
	- Use them to monetize your groups and/or worlds.
	- When you create a subscription, it is automatically connected to your group store.
- World stores allow you to sell [listings](/economy/listings).
	- Use them to monetize your worlds.
	- You can choose freely choose which listings are available for purchase in your world stores.

## Viewing your Store

Any user can view and purchase from your store by opening your group or world. They can see a **Store** tab in VRChat and the website, which lists everything for purchase from your Store.

You can share a link to your store by copying its URL.

Or you can ask users have a user navigate to the **Groups** tab in VRChat. From here, they can either join your Group by typing in the Group code, which will look something like `Test.0000, or they can search for it via the Group search function.

You can use [Udon](/economy/sdk/udon-documentation) to sell your published listings and subscriptions. You don't *need* to publish your store!
