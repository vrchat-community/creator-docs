Setting up Unity to create Quest content is actually pretty straightforward. This image covers it pretty well:

:::caution Requires Additional Setup

[You need to install Unity's Android SDK](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/android-sdksetup.html). Otherwise the option won't pop up.

If you're starting a brand new project, this won't take long at all. However, if you're converting a Windows platform project to an Android platform project, you will have to convert your assets appropriately. This can take quite a while for larger projects.

For more details on best practices when working with dual-platform projects, read our documentation on [Cross-Platform Setup](/platforms/android/cross-platform-setup).
