Avatar Dynamics is a new suite of features aimed at creating fun and interesting interactions between avatars. Understandably, these are some powerful features, so there’s a lot to cover here!

The two primary features of Avatar Dynamics are [PhysBones](/avatars/avatar-dynamics/physbones) and [Contacts](/avatars/avatar-dynamics/contacts).

These features are governed by the [Permissions and Settings](https://docs.vrchat.com/docs/permissions-and-settings) system, which gives you full and complete control over who can interact with you.

SDK3-Avatars contains an example avatar in `Packages\VRChat SDK\Avatars\Samples\Dynamics\Robot Avatar` that is useful for trying out implementing Avatar Dynamics systems.
