# Avatar Components

VRChat's SDK contains a suite of features to create fun and exciting interactions between avatars.

- [PhysBones](/common-components/physbones) allows bones to be affected by physics or by other players.
- [Contacts](/common-components/contacts) can detect collisions to trigger animations or effects.
- [Constraints](/common-components/constraints) copies the movement of bones on your avatar.
- [Head Chop](/avatars/avatar-components/vrc-headchop) allows you to hide or show bones on your avatar from your first-person view.

PhysBones and Contacts applied to avatars are governed by the [Permissions and Settings](https://docs.vrchat.com/docs/permissions-and-settings) system, which gives you complete control over who can interact with you.
