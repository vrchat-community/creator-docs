- Rigidbody
- Collider

| Parameter | Description |
| :-- | :--|
| Momentum Transfer Method        | This defines how the collision force will be added to the other object which was hit, using Rigidbody.AddForceAtPosition.<br />Note: the force will only be added if 'AllowCollisionTransfer' is on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| Physical Root                   | Can be used if the root of the object is not on the same gameobject as this script, allows for multiple pickup points on a single object.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Exact Gun                       | The position object will be held if set to Exact Gun                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| Auto Hold                       | Should the pickup remain in the user's hand after they let go of the grab button.<br />- Auto Detect: Automatically detects what to do<br />- Yes: After the grab button is released the pickup remains in the hand until the drop button is pressed and released<br />- No: After the grab button is released the pickup is let go<br />Note: This only applies to control schemes which lack an independent "Use" input from "Grab", such as Desktop, Vive, and Vive-like input systems. This does not apply to Quest, Quest-like, and other input systems with a defined trigger. |
| Use Text                        | Text that appears when the user has an object equipped, prompting them to "fire" the object.<br />Requires "Auto Hold" to be set to "Yes".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
