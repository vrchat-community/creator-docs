## What is Udon?
**VRChat Udon** is a programming language built completely in-house by the VRChat Development Team. It is designed to be secure, performant, and easy to use via the **VRChat Udon Node Graph**, a built-in visual programming interface that uses nodes and wires (we call them “noodles”) to connect flow, inputs, and outputs. You can build complex behaviors with Udon-- far more complex and easier to understand than unwieldy chains of Triggers and Actions.

Not only can you replicate the full behavior of Triggers and Actions with VRChat Udon, but you can create your own behaviors, sync variables with others, interact with scenes, interact with players, and more.

In addition, Udon runs in both the VRChat client *and* the Unity Editor, allowing you to test and debug your creations with ease.

For the more technically inclined: **VRChat Udon** is a VM running bytecode compiled from **Udon Assembly**. You can generate **Udon Assembly** using the built-in **VRChat Udon Node Graph** UI, writing your own **Udon Assembly**, or even by writing your own compiler to generate **Udon Assembly** or bytecode programs directly.

## Current Udon Status
**Udon is our current main-line standard system for World Creation!**

You can use the [Udon Node Graph](/worlds/udon/graph) to create Udon programs with a graphical interface. This is a lot like Unity animators, Blender shaders or geometry nodes, Unreal blueprints, and many other similar methods. It's a great starting point-- but also, some people just prefer nodes over code!

Of course, if you do prefer code, you can always write Udon using [UdonSharp](https://udonsharp.docs.vrchat.com/)! UdonSharp is a way to write Udon in a way very similar to C#. If you're already familiar with programming, U# might be the easiest way forward for you!
