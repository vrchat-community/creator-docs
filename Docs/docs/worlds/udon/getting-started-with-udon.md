If you don't know what Udon is, read [What is Udon](/worlds/udon) first. 

There are two ways for you to get started with Udon. You can use our [Creator Companion](https://vcc.docs.vrchat.com) to do so. 

# Using the Creator Companion

Here are all the steps to get you started with Udon using the Creator Companion.

1. Visit [The VRChat Download Page](https://vrchat.com/home/download).

2. Login with your VRChat account or create it if you don't have one yet.

3. Download the Creator Companion and follow its [installation steps](https://vcc.docs.vrchat.com/guides/getting-started). 

4. Create a new Project by opening the Creator Companion, going to Projects Tab and pressing "New", select the "World" Template.

5. Open your project by clicking Open in the Creator Companion. You can also use the Unity Hub to open your project, either is fine!

From there, you're ready to start!
