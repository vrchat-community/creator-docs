This page lists the current Unity version you should use when creating content for VRChat, as well as linking to the documentation for our Creator Companion.

# Current Unity Version
The current Unity version in use by VRChat is [**Unity 2019.4.31f1**](https://unity3d.com/unity/whats-new/2019.4.31). We recommend downloading it with [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/download).

Ensure you are using this *exact* version! Using a version newer than our current supported version may permit you to upload, but **you won't be able to see your content in VRChat**. 
:::note VRChat Creator Companion

We strongly recommend using the [**VRChat Creator Companion**](https://vcc.docs.vrchat.com/), as it takes care of choosing the correct Unity Version for you. It also keeps the VRChat SDK and community-made packages up to date.

# Troubleshooting
- [Make sure to activate your Unity Personal license](https://support.unity.com/hc/en-us/articles/211438683-How-do-I-activate-my-license-) before using VRChat's SDK. Unity is free for personal use.
- To learn more about the Unity Hub, visit [Unity's documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/hub/manual/index.html).
- If you're experiencing issues related to the SDK itself, please read our [SDK Troubleshooting](/sdk/sdk-troubleshooting) page.
