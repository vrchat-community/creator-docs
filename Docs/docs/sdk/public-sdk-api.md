The VRChat SDK provides a set of interfaces and methods you can use to enhance your world and avatar build process. 

You can find the **Public SDK API** folder in both SDKs:

- Packages > VRChat SDK - Worlds > Editor > VRCSDK > SDK3 > Public SDK API
- Packages > VRChat SDK - Avatars > Editor > VRCSDK > SDK3A > Public SDK API

However, most of the events and methods are shared between both the world and avatar SDKs and are defined in the **Base SDK Package.**

# What's available?

For the most up-to-date list of events and methods, we recommend looking at the files directly mentioned above.

But here is a short list of what is available:

- OnEnable/OnDisable events of the main SDK Panel
- Build Start/End events
- Upload Success/Error events
- Build, Build and Test, and Build and Upload methods

:::note
If you run into exceptions during the build process, you can view the list of expected exceptions in the Interface definitions.

## Examples

### Getting an instance of a builder

Connecting to `OnSdkPanelEnable` will ensure that the SDK window was opened and the builders were registered. You can then use `TryGetBuilder` to get an instance of the builder you need.

> You can call `VRCSdkControlPanel.TryGetBuilder` at any point in time, but it will return false if the SDK window is not open or the builder you're trying to access is not available.

```cs
[InitializeOnLoadMethod]
public static void RegisterSDKCallback()
{
    VRCSdkControlPanel.OnSdkPanelEnable += AddBuildHook;
}

private IVRCSdkAvatarBuilderApi _builder;

private static void AddBuildHook(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    VRCSdkControlPanel.TryGetBuilder<IVRCSdkAvatarBuilderApi>(out _builder);
}
```

### Running code before the build

`OnSdkBuildStart` runs right before the SDK kicks off the build process, but after validations and Build Request Callbacks have passed.

```cs
[InitializeOnLoadMethod]
public static void RegisterSDKCallback()
{
    VRCSdkControlPanel.OnSdkPanelEnable += AddBuildHook;
}

private static void AddBuildHook(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    if (VRCSdkControlPanel.TryGetBuilder<IVRCSdkAvatarBuilderApi>(out var builder))
    {
        builder.OnSdkBuildStart += OnBuildStarted;
    }
}

private static void OnBuildStarted(object sender, object target)
{
    Debug.Log("Building " + ((GameObject) target).name);
}
```

### Building from script

```cs
[MenuItem("My Tools/Build Selected Avatar")]
public static async void BuildSelectedAvatar()
{
    var avatar = Selection.activeGameObject;
    if (!VRCSdkControlPanel.TryGetBuilder<IVRCSdkAvatarBuilderApi>(out var builder)) return;
    try {
      await builder.BuildAndTest(avatar);
    } catch (Exception e) {
      Debug.LogError(e.Message);
    }
}
```
## Heads up
:::caution
If you're currently using reflection to access the SDK internals, we recommend switching to the public API as soon as possible.
:::
We're going to make our best effort to provide a stable API, but it's still subject to change in the future. We recommend leveraging semver to define which version of the SDK your tools are compatible with. [Learn more here](https://vcc.docs.vrchat.com/vpm/packages/#versions-and-ranges).
