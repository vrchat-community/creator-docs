# Current Unity Version

The current Unity version used by VRChat is [**2022.3.6f1**](https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/2022.3.6).

This version is an update from our previous version, **Unity 2019.4.31f1**, and includes many improvements such as faster iteration times, improved asset import times, better editor stability, fully featured C# 8 support, a quick search feature, [and much more!](https://unity.com/releases/lts)

**Unity 2022 is required to use the latest version of the VRChat SDK**, and we strongly recommend upgrading if you are still on Unity 2019. Without upgrading, you can't access any future SDK updates, and some previously made content might experience issues.

For instructions on how to upgrade, [visit our Unity 2019 to 2022 documentation](/sdk/upgrade/unity-2022).
