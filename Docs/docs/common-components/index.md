# Common Components

Components on this page work both on [avatars](/avatars) and in [worlds](/worlds).

- [PhysBones](/common-components/physbones) allow bones on your avatar or in your world to be affected by physics or by other users.
- [Contacts](/common-components/contacts) can detect collisions to trigger animations and effects on avatars, or Udon functionality in worlds.
- [Constraints](/common-components/constraints) allow transforms to be moved around relative to each other in complex ways.
