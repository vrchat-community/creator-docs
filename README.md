GitHub will help you set up a fork of the docs so you can edit them and submit a Pull Request to this repo, to have your changes integrated.

## Local Development
You can also directly fork this repo to suggest many changes at once.
1. Fork the repo to your own GitHub account.
2. Edit the markdown docs on your own machine.
3. Use Docusaurus to preview the updates if you want!

## Using Docusaurus
The docs are built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs/), so you can run a local server to see what your changes will look like very quickly.
1. Clone the repo (or your fork).
2. Run `npm install` in the `Docs` folder to install the required packages.
3. Run `npm run start` in the `Docs` folder to run the Docusaurus server, which will build the site and open a browser pointing to a local server with your live preview. Just change a page or add a new one, and the server will hot-reload the content so you can see it right away.
